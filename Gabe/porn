% Porn by Mike Dombrovsky v1.0
% Super Amazing Turing Choosable Adventure Engine

% A simple game engine that allows a player to make a simple Choose Your Own Adventure game
% Input variables are intergers because it allows to make a parameter where if an interger is
% too high, it won't let them make that input and will give an error message instead

var win1 : int := Window.Open ("position:center;center,graphics:900;600,nobuttonbar,title: SATCA") % Opens main window
var input, inres : int  % Takes user input, resets game
var res : int := 1 % Reset game
var logo : int := Pic.FileNew ("logo.jpg") % Placeholder logo. MadOctopus logo can be downloaded @ https://goo.gl/Qup6O8

% This if structure looks for the placeholder logo. If it does not exist where the file is saved,
% it will give an error. Otherwise, it puts the logo. Keep in mind that this logo is only designed
% for a 900*600px screen or window.
